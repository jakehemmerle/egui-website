# Easter Egg Ideas for Jake Hemmerle's Personal Website

1. **Konami Code**: Implement an easter egg that is triggered when the user enters the Konami code on their keyboard. This could reveal a hidden message or change the theme of the website temporarily.

2. **Hidden BASE Jumping Video**: Include a small, almost invisible icon somewhere on the BASE jumping section. When clicked, it could play a video of Jake BASE jumping.

3. **Book Recommendations**: In the reading list section, a certain combination of clicks on book titles could reveal Jake's top-secret favorite book.

4. **Blockchain Puzzle**: Create a small cryptographic puzzle related to blockchain. When solved, it could give the user a small reward, like a discount code for a book or a shoutout on the website.

5. **Hidden Playlist**: Include a hidden link to a playlist of Jake's favorite coding music on SoundCloud.

6. **Rust Compiler Easter Egg**: In the Rust section, clicking on a hidden Rust logo could trigger an animation of the Rust mascot, Ferris, doing something fun.

7. **Instagram Photo Gallery**: If a user hovers over the Instagram link for a certain amount of time, a small gallery of Jake's latest Instagram photos could pop up.

8. **Goodreads Bookshelf**: A hidden interaction in the Goodreads section could display a virtual bookshelf with more detailed views of Jake's book collection.

9. **Personal Quotes**: Scatter some of Jake's personal quotes or tweets throughout the site that only appear when you hover over certain elements.

10. **Interactive Blog Post Titles**: Make some blog post titles interactive, where clicking on them could change the title to an amusing alternative or a pun related to the content.
